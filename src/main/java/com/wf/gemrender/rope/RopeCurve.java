/**
 * The curve a rope hangs in, and the Java half of {@code rope.glsl}.
 *
 * <p>A rope is a straight line between its endpoints plus a quadratic sag along -Y:
 * {@code P(t) = A + (B - A) t + sag * 4t(1 - t) * -Y}. That is a parabola, which is the shape a
 * uniformly loaded cable takes and the standard approximation to a catenary.
 *
 * <p><b>It is deliberately not a catenary.</b> The closed-form catenary is a function of horizontal
 * distance, so it has no value at all when the two endpoints are vertically above one another — and
 * a mooring chain, the case this was written for, is exactly vertical. The parabola is defined for
 * every configuration, costs four multiply-adds instead of a {@code cosh} and a Newton solve, and at
 * the sag ratios anything in a game uses the two differ by well under a pixel.
 *
 * <p>Everything here is {@code float}, and in the same order as the shader does it, so a value
 * predicted on the CPU matches the one drawn rather than merely rounding to it.
