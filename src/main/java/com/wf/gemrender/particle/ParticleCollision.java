 * in advance: the trajectory is a closed form, so the whole arc is knowable the moment the particle is born,
 * and walking it against the world costs one sweep at spawn instead of a test per particle per tick. What
 * comes out is a {@link Contact} — two ages and a face — and from then on the shader is still evaluating a
 * closed form, still writing nothing per frame.
 *
 * <p>The sweep must agree with what the GPU draws, so it walks the arc through {@link ParticleMotion}, which
 * is the same closed form {@code particle.glsl} evaluates. Predicting through a second, tidier model would
 * put contacts where the particle visibly is not.
 *
 * <p>Nothing here knows about Minecraft: the world arrives as a {@link Probe}, which is what makes the
 * prediction testable against a floor nobody had to load a level to build. {@link LevelContactProbe} is the
